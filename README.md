# Vibe
Vibe is an event discovery app that helps you find events. Whether you're looking for concerts, theater, stand up or other local events.

The free Ticketmaster Discovery API has limited data availability and functionality compared to paid plans. As a result, you may encounter restrictions on the amount or specific details about events.

Features

- Vibe allows users to purchase tickets directly through Ticketmaster without leaving the app. When you view an event and click on the "Buy Tickets" button, you will be redirected to Ticketmaster's event ticket selection page.
- User Authentication (Coming Soon): Integration with Firebase for phone number and email link login.

Navigation
- Go Router: Manages the app's routing and navigation
